### Train a Smartcab How to Drive
by Robert Latimer

### Description

The goal of this project is to train a Smartcab to safely navigate city streets filled with traffic and stop lights. By implementing a [Q-Learning algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning), we are able to facilitate an environment where the Smartcab is able to learn from its mistakes. It will make numerous errors at first, but over time, it will become better and better at safely nagivating its environment.

For full detail of the project, please see 'smartcab.ipynb'.

### Install

* **Python 2.7** with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) library installed

### Code

All original coding was completed in the `smartcab/agent.py` python file. Additional supporting python code can be found in `smartcab/enviroment.py`, `smartcab/planner.py`, and `smartcab/simulator.py`.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `smartcab/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```python smartcab/agent.py```  
```python -m smartcab.agent```

This will run the `agent.py` file and execute the agent code.
